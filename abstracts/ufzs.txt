It is estimated that 600,000+ outdoor fires occur annually across the U.S. Most of these fires are in an urban setting. Tools for predicting and simulating fire spread within these urban environments are limited. We contribute a new tool prototype to locate and classify hazardous urban fire zones. We also make available a simulation framework to provide estimated fire-related quantities such as the total emissions of CO, CO2 and soot yielded from a simualted fire eventt Our tool can be used to Identify fire-prone urban and vegetation layouts, to quantify the impact of fires in those regions from the simulation's visualization and output quantities, and to simulate previous fires to quantify their emissions and visualize the impact on the environment.
